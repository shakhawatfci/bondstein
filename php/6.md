# Submitting a form

we can submit form by html form element with a submit button (can be in js too)
 and action tag will determine in which page we want to process the form data 

 # event after form submited

 when the form got submitted we can get form data with super global variable like $_GET and $_POST according to method of post
 then action will be taken with data as required
