# Read Write File in php

in php for reading and writing a file we have to open it via fopen() which take first parameter for file and 2nd one for mode of operation 
r for reading and w for writing.Below example are given (There are some others parameter then r , w)

# Read file 

The first parameter of fopen() contains the name of the file to be opened and the second parameter specifies in which mode the file should be opened. fread() function which read the file by taking the size of file
 (it takes how many byte or char  it will read) 

 <pre>
  <code>
   $file = fopen('myfile.txt','r');
   echo fread($file,filesize("myfile.txt"));
  </code>
 </pre>
 it will read the whole file 

# Write file 

Writing file means manipulating file using external text . The fopen() function is also used to create a file. Maybe a little confusing, but in PHP, a file is created using the same function used to open files . If given file in fopen not exist then it will create a file in writing mode . 

 <pre>
  <code>
$file = fopen("newfile.txt", "w");
$txt = "Hello World";
fwrite($file, $txt);
  </code>
 </pre>
 it will write a file with  Hello World content . If file previously hold any value it will erase it .
 For not erasing file content we can use different parameter in fopen
